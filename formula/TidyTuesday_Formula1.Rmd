## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Data Download

<br> This code is to download all of the necessary datasets prior to focusing on individual ones. 

```{r}
circuits <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/circuits.csv')
constructor_results <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/constructor_results.csv')
constructor_standings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/constructor_standings.csv')
constructors <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/constructors.csv')
driver_standings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/driver_standings.csv')
drivers <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/drivers.csv')
lap_times <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/lap_times.csv')
pit_stops <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/pit_stops.csv')
qualifying <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/qualifying.csv')
races <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/races.csv')
results <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/results.csv')
seasons <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/seasons.csv')
status <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-07/status.csv')
```

## Dataset Selection

<br> Although Tshering and I started working with other datasets, we realised that was more time consuming given that we had to create a new variable for averages - so we decided to go ahead with the preset code as seen in the Tidy Tuesday instruction guide, which is shown below.  

```{r}
 driver_results_df <- driver_standings %>%
 left_join(races, by = "raceId") %>%
 rename(driver_url = url) %>%
 left_join(drivers, by = "driverId")
```

## Data Filtering

<br> The following chunk filters drivers based on 5 select nationalities and aggregates the number of wins.  We picked some of these nationalities since they are prominent in the F1 Space.


```{r}
Wins <- driver_results_df %>%
 filter(nationality %in% c("British", "Finnish", "German", "French", "Spanish", "American")) %>%
 group_by(nationality) %>%
 summarise(wins_cum = sum(wins)) %>%
 arrange(wins_cum)
```


## Data Visualization

<br> The following chunk below helps visualize the data and better understand which nationalities have record Formula 1 wins and by how much of a margin. We can see that Britiain is leading with short of 2500 wins, while German lags them with almost 1750 wins. 


```{r}
Wins %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = nationality,y = wins_cum, fill = nationality)) + geom_col() +
 labs(title = "Nationalities with Record Formula 1 Wins from 1950-2021",
 x = "Nationality",
 y = "Total Wins") +
  theme_clean() + theme(legend.position = "none")

```
